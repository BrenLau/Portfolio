            I am a software engineer who graduated from App Academy's full stack web development boot camp. App Academy is a vigorous six-month program designed to jam years of software knowledge and work applicable skills in a short period of time. This helped me learn how to grow at a rapid rate, as I was able to catch on to concepts and technologies relatively quickly. I was able to pass every coding exam with a perfect score, demonstrating my ability to problem solve with newfound knowledge.
